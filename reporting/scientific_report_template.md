[Your Name/Organization]

## Abstract:

This report details the analysis of deer movement patterns based on aerial imagery processed through our custom AI pipeline. We present the methodology for trackway detection, validation, and analysis, including metrics for spatial autocorrelation, edge effects, and uncertainty quantification.

## 1. Introduction

[Provide background on the importance of studying deer movement, conservation context, and the objectives of this study.]

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Data Acquisition

- **Aerial Imagery:** [Describe the source, resolution, and other characteristics of the aerial imagery used.]
- **Ground Truth Data:** [Describe any ground truth data used for validation, such as GPS collar data or field observations.]

### 2.2. AI-Powered Detection

- **Model:** YOLOv8
- **Training Data:** [Describe the dataset used to train the model.]
- **Detection Process:** [Explain how the model is used to detect deer in the imagery.]

### 2.3. Trackway Analysis

- **Clustering:** DBSCAN (eps=[value], min_samples=[value])
- **Biological Validation:**
    - Max Speed: [value] m/s
    - Min Length: [value] m
    - Max Turn Angle: [value] degrees
    - Max Tortuosity: [value]
- **Spatial Autocorrelation:** Moran's I
- **Edge Effect Analysis:** [Describe how edge effects were analyzed, e.g., distance to nearest road/fence.]

### 2.4. Uncertainty Quantification

- **Confidence Scores:** The mean and standard deviation of the YOLO detection scores are used to represent the confidence in each trackway.

## 3. Results

[Present the results of the analysis, including maps, charts, and statistical summaries.]

- **Trackway Summary:**
    - Number of trackways detected: [value]
    - Average trackway length: [value] m
    - Average speed: [value] m/s
- **Spatial Patterns:**
    - Moran's I: [value] (p-value: [value])
- **Habitat Use:**
    - [Present findings on habitat preference.]

## 4. Discussion

[Interpret the results in the context of ecological literature and conservation goals. Discuss the limitations of the study and suggest areas for future research.]

## 5. References

[List all citations.]
